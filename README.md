### 🔷 Overview

`echosynth-core` is the sovereign engine of **EchoSynth™** — a next-generation, emotionally responsive co-creation system. It fuses:

- 🧠 Adaptive emotional intelligence (`EchoMind`)
- 🎨 Mood-reactive UX design (`MoodPulse`)
- ⚛️ Quantum-inspired decision logic (`QuantumCore`)
- 🔁 Autonomous self-rewriting engine (`Aurora Cortex`)
- 🛠️ Dream-to-app prompt builder (`DreamLoom`)

This repository contains core modules powering **Datasphere-Q**, the synthetic creative environment.
